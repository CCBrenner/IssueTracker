This folder is to house the virtualenv files for the project. An attempt was made using pipenv but due to
inexperience and novelty it was benched for the moment in favor of a different endeavor. 

Pipenv is meant to replaceme virtualenv and perform similar functions as npm for Node.js. Package management is what
is being developed on with this - simpler ways to install required packages of a project with a local scope easily and
seemlessly and to create such a file functioning similar to requirements.txt which can be create from the projects
current dependencies for transportability, most notably for pushing to a GitHub repo and cloning from it. 

More research is needed on how to use pipenv or virtualenv effectively for these purposes (pipenv uses virtualenv within itself).
