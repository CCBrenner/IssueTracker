# Issue Tracker

Name: Issue Tracker (https://issuetracker.brenner.app)

Description:
This is a web app coded in Django, one of two most popular Python frameworks. Other technologies used include HTML, CSS, JS, W3.CSS, and PostgreSQL. It is a simple web app that allows for creation of a user, projects, and issues in a tree structure. It works like a bug tracker and was designed for use with software development use cases though it can be expanded in its scope to take on any kind of project or to-do list use case. This web app was modeled after the web app Jira.

Installation:
Please note that this is original code and is not open for public use on any website other than the one listed.

To install this Django app please follow the common steps affiliated with setup on a Linux server and with Django in general. PostgreSQL is used as the default database so this will need to be set up either on a separate server and then connected to the web server or setup within a hybrid environment such as a Heroku Dyno. Package that are required for installation are listed in the requirements.txt file at the top level of the root directory. Environment variables for password recovery and the secret key will need to be setup. The location of these in the file structure can be found in the settings.py file of the issue_tracker directory/internal app. Any other questions can be forwarded to collynbrenner@gmail.com.
